My biggest wish it to get a Serenity report showing only the failures. Sometimes we have thousands of scenarios and just a few failures spread out amongst all the green and it is time consuming to have to individually locate and drill into the failures.
When tried to open the results of a test scenario with lots of results, it takes ages to load.
Search functionality to filter the reports across the scenarios not just index page
